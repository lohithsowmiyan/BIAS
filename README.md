## **Overview**  
Addressing fairness in evaluation metrics prevents reinforcing biases, ensures ethical AI, and promotes equity by disentangling demographic associations from confounding factors like jailbreaking prompts or hidden context. Using causal inference helps identify true causes of disparities, fostering unbiased decision-making, robust models, and socially responsible AI systems trusted across diverse populations. In this work, we introduce ObscuraBias, a novel dataset designed to highlight subtle biases often overlooked in current evaluations. Additionally, we propose a groundbreaking metric for assessing the fairness of existing standard evaluation metrics‚Äîsuch as toxicity and regard‚Äîthrough the lens of causal inference, providing a more robust framework to validate and improve fairness in model assessments.
